[Link to the project wiki](https://reference.digilentinc.com/learn/programmable-logic/tutorials/arty-z7-xadc-demo/start)

When loading this project with a newer version of Vivado, an error will be issued about xadc IP. You need just to update the xadc ip to the current version (select xadc component, then properties-->IP) and the project can be built.
